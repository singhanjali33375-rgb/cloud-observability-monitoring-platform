# cloud-observability-monitoring-platform
A production-grade observability and monitoring project for cloud-native and Kubernetes environments, implementing metrics, logs, traces, alerting, and dashboards using industry-standard tools and best practices.
# Cloud Observability & Monitoring Platform

This project demonstrates an advanced observability and monitoring setup
for cloud-native and Kubernetes-based applications. It focuses on
deep visibility into system health, performance, and reliability.

## Why This Project Is Rare & Powerful
- Covers metrics, logs, and traces together
- Production-grade monitoring stack
- Kubernetes-focused observability
- Real-world alerting & dashboards
- Industry-standard tooling

## Core Pillars of Observability
- Metrics: What is happening
- Logs: Why it happened
- Traces: Where it happened

## Architecture Overview
Application → Metrics / Logs / Traces  
→ Prometheus / Loki / Tempo  
→ Grafana Dashboards  
→ Alerts → Ops / Dev Teams

## Tools & Stack
- Kubernetes
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Alertmanager
- Loki (Logs)
- Tempo / Jaeger (Tracing)
- Node Exporter
- cAdvisor

## Folder Structure
app/ kubernetes/ metrics/ logs/ tracing/ alerts/ dashboards/ scripts/ .github/

## Learning Outcome
This project proves strong understanding of
observability, monitoring, reliability engineering,
and production cloud operations.
